This is a CLI tool for automatically creating the required files for a functioning Chrome extension. Run it through Terminal (Mac OSX) or Command Line (Windows) with the command : python3 main.py : This being my first Python project I am very open to feedback. Please feel free suggest improvements or additional features. As this project in its current state only makes the *necessary* files for an extension, I will be updating it in the future to add additional files.
